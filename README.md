# Bachelor-Thesis
This thesis evaluates different algorithmic approaches for solving the 0/1 Knapsack Problem, a combinatorial op- timization problem. The project involves implementing and analyzing dynamic programming and greedy approaches. These methods are evaluated for their efficiency, scalability, and performance on small, medium and large problem instances.
